# Contributing

The content of this collection is made by people like you, a community of individuals collaborating on making the world better through developing automation software.

We are actively accepting new contributors.

Any kind of contribution is very welcome, whether it be adding support for another Linux distro, fixing a bug or improving documentation.

Discussions regarding contributions and their impact on the wider project will be conducted in the [issue tracker](https://github.com/dandyrow/dandyrow.archlinux/actions) on the collection's GitHub repo.

The final say on any contributions to this collection will be made by me (dandyrow) following a discussion about the contribution and the wider implications it has on the project's goals. Having said that I am very open to all improvements anyone wishes to make.

## How to contribute

1. Open an issue on the issue tracker linked above proposing the changes you would like to make.
2. Fork the repository and make the proposed change(s), asking for help / advice in the issue you opened for the change(s).
3. Create a pull request against the main branch of the project.
4. If any changes are requried before the pull request is accepted, you will be asked to make said changes.

When proposing changes and creating pull requests for changes you've made please keep the reason for the changes focused. For example, you wouldn't bundle the addition of support for a new distro in a role with fixing a bug in a module which occurs only on Ubuntu as these changes address different things and therefore should be split into two separate pull requests.
